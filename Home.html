    <h2> About Treasure Hunt</h2>
    <p>Our treasure hunts are information-based scavenger hunts, or puzzle hunts, in which teams use their collective brainpower to solve clues.  Each team is presented with a group of puzzles, or clues, which teams must solve in order to find a piece of information.
        Each clue leads to a location within walking distance, where players must find and use a vital piece of information to answer a question.  This information could be words from a historical plaque, a series of numbers or an address, a landmark, or any other unique item that many of us walking down the street might merely pass by, unless we were looking for it.
        Teams travel through the streets of the playing area racing to see who will be first to find all of the information.
        After solving all the clues teams will return their answer sheets to the designated endpoint.
        The earliest entry with the most correct answers wins. Company team building hunts last about two and a half hours.  Larger Public Hunts can last up to four hours.
